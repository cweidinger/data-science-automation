Use software engineering to automate the data science workflow.

# Data Driven Problem Solving

- problem evaluation
- data exploration
- data preprocessing
- model training/testing
- model comparison
- model deployment

# Given a data set

- given the shape of the dataset
  - what methods are appropriate to analyze and predict the set
  - for example,
    - MNIST handwritten digit set - 
- formulate the possible questions
  - which variables would we try to predict
- organize the questions from most to least interesting
- For each question
  - Do Data Driven Problem Solving on it:
    - discover if the data can answer your question
    - find suggestions for what may be needed to further answer that question

- cache output of analysis for meta-analyses
- Use SGD to tune hyperparameters
